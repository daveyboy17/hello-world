# hello-world
My first repository

This was made as part of the online tutorial so don't expect too much in the way of content here.

I am a senior (i.e.old) software engineer with decades of experience with microcontrollers (8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit) programming originally in assembler (those were the days) but latterly in C (so much easier).
